On unix systems, do `git clone https://github.com/hkgit03/vimrc ~/.vim`.

On windows, source `core.vim` in the `_vimrc` file.


## Initial Setup

First, vundle has to be cloned into the bundle directory.

In the repo run `make`, start Vim, run `:PluginInstall`, restart Vim, and you're done.

If you run into problems, manually clone [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) into `<repo_dir>/bundle/VundleVim`.
